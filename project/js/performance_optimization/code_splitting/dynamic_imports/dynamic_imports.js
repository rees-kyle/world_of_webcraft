// dynamic imports; to load modules on-demand, based on user actions or other runtime conditions

// scenario: load a complex feature, only when a user clicks a button to view it, rather than loading it when the page first loads

// benefit: on-demand loading; loads heavy or infrequently used modules only when needed, keeping the initial load time low
